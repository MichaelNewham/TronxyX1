# Summary

### If you use this fan duct & think it makes your prints look better, don't forget to TIP! ;)

This is my version of the "circular fan duct" for the Anet A8 printer (and other compatible printers).
Highlights:
- it's actually semi-circular. The circular one deforms after a while if printed in PLA (and I use/have only PLA), so I designed this version.
- it snaps to the fan a lot more securely (on the outside of the fan), and there is no chance of falling off during print.
- designed in such way, that the air blows just below the tip of the nozzle. The original design was blowing too far down.

Designed in Blender, by heavily modifying http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1874390 - simplifying the mesh, adding the new attachment part etc.

Note: there is newer, and more effective fan duct I designed: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2133328
