# Post-Printing

## Step 1 - Attach bracket to hot-end cover

Once the bracket is printed, it can be attached to the left side of the hot-end cover via M3 machine screws. The length of the screws does not matter, just make sure they are not long enough to touch the hot end.

## Step 2 - Attach 50mm radial fan to bracket

Attach the radial fan to the bracket using M3 fasteners with a washer between the head of the fastener and the radial fan. The radial fan mounting holes are 5mm in diameter so you can use any fastener smaller than M5. If you use a smaller fastener than M5, there is a little bit of play which can help with aligning the fan duct with the nozzle.
