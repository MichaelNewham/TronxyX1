# Summary

all you guys and gals out there that are mad they now have to print a new better set you can blame (thank) Rob Zarfas from the FB "Tronxy X3, X1, X5 3D Printer Users (All models)" group
it was his suggestions and ideas that helped me draw this up

there are over 100 changers (i stopped counting at about 85)

in general its more compact and a better fitting unit

i have now printed this as yet but all the dimensions should work

ok so i have moved the plug hole just reprint the center section
