# Summary

I designed this X axis belt tensioner from scratch for the Tronxy X1/X3 printer (inspired by [Tronxy X3 x-belt tensioner](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2020468) by [idig3d](https://www.thingiverse.com/idig3d) )
My goal was to create a sturdy and reliable tensioner that doesn't require additional screws and nuts.

Just print it, take your current idler, put it together and done.

[UPDATE]: Added more pictures explaining how to assemble the tensioner

# Print Settings

Printer: Tronxy X1
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.2

Notes: 
If you haven't calibrated your X and Y dimensional accuracy the nut might be too tight or too loose.
In this case you can simply scale the nut in the X and Y direction (Z should stay the same)

# Custom Section

## mounting options...

I think it's fairly easy to mod the bracket to have alternative mounting if you'd like to use it for a different type of 3d printer...
